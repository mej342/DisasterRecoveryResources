### Disaster Recovery Resources List
#### User Story
As a new A/V archivist, I want to create/build an open source database that provides disaster recovery resources for other A/V archivist.
#### Need
There are many disaster recovery resources available on variety of websites related to collections management, archiving, and conservation. However, as a new A/V archivist, I see a need for a centralized resource list. A centralized list would eliminate the need to search multiple websites in order to locate nearby vendors.
#### Objectives/Goals
The objectives and goals for this project are outlined in the attached "Project Charter."
